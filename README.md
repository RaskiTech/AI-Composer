Artificial intelligence that generates music.

![App](App.png?raw=true "App")

AI Composer is a program that generates music for you. It has sliders that determine what the song will look like. These sliders can be used to slightly modify the song. You can also use others sliders that modify the song as a whole: You can make the notes longer, create more notes or change the instrument etc.

All the needed files are under the "Program" forder, so you can download just that if you want to. The Program allows you to modify that directory, as long as you keep the Assets folder in the same directory as the executable.

# Download
To download the program just click the "Code" button at the top right corner. From the dropdown you can select "Download ZIP". After it has downloaded, extract all by right-clicking on the zip. The program will be under the Program folder.
