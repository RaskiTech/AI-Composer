Artificial intelligence that generates music.

![App](/App.PNG?raw=true "App")

AI Composer is a program that generates music for you. It has sliders that determine what the song will look like. These sliders can be used to slightly modify the song. You can also use a few sliders at the bottom to modify the whole song: You can make the notes longer, create more notes, change the instrument etc. You can download the music as Wave or Midi.

This program uses AI to generate its music. It was trained with over 25 000 tracks to procude the best possible music.
